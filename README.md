# UI-Generator-Language
A language for generating UI.

Initially we are planning to make all the functionality. Later we will do the language part.

Example syntax of the language:

```c++
CREATE `Reactangle` WITH (width = 10%, height = 10%, top = 50%, left = 50%, fillColor = #FF0000FF, borderWidth = 2, borderColor = #000000FF) as `r1`
```
